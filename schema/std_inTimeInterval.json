  "description": "With this extension time intervals can be modeled. This allows to specify a time window in which the data must be deleted. The DCA does not have to delete the data immediately. If there is still time in the window, the DCA can postpone the deletion to a later time. This can be useful if the DCA wants to perform the deletion with less expensive resources (e.g. unused Cloud CPU cycles).",
